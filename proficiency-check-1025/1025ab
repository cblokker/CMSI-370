    interaction style?

    Learnability


2.  What is the cognitive rationale behind why the menus/forms/dialogs
    interaction style tends to excel at the above usability metric?

    Well developed menus/forms/dialogs are intuitive, requiring the user to have very little experience with the interface to effectively use it.  Also, since the interface is intuitive and easy to learn, theres is low recall time even with infrequent use.  The user can also easily recognize these menus/forms/dialogs.
