1.  What, typically is the strongest usability metric of the menus/forms/dialogue 
    interaction style?

    Learnability


2.  What is the cognitive rationale behind why the menus/forms/dialogs
    interaction style tends to excel at the above usability metric?

    Well developed menus/forms/dialogs are intuitive, requiring the user to have very little experience with the interface to effectively use it.  Also, since the interface is intuitive and easy to learn, theres is low recall time even with infrequent use.  The user can also easily recognize these menus/forms/dialogs.

# JD: Perfect, these answers provide the needed information. (1a, 1b, 1d: +)

1025b (1b, 1d)

1.  What, typically, is the weakest usability metric of the menus/forms/dialogs
    interaction style, and why?

    
    Satisfaction.  Generally, menus/forms/dialogs primarily need to get the job done (not prone to errors, intuitive so little learning is required,...)  Leter, the user can focus on satisfaction.

2.  Name a feature that can be included in a menus/forms/dialogs user interface
    that addresses this metric?

    Animate a sub-menu falling down when you click on a button within the menus and choose clean colors for those menu items.

# JD: Your answers are well-explained and sensible; their only issue is that there
#     is a better answer (i.e., the very subjectivity of satisfaction keeps it from
#     being an *unequivocal* weakest metric).  There is a metric that is objectively
#     weakest overall, for any menu system.  Also, there is a remedy to this weakness
#     that really does its job quite well.
#
#     Still, your answers demonstrate a good degree of knowledge and understanding
#     in this area. (1b, 1d: |)
